# CSE 437s Week 2: Build a To-Do App

**Live Demo:** [To-Do App](https://j1ngy1.github.io/week-2-todo-app-J1ngy1/)

### Key Features
- **Adding Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a title, optional due date, and optional priority level.
- **Viewing Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in a list, showing the title, due date, and priority (if applicable).
- **Marking Tasks Complete**: Tasks can be marked as completed, visually distinguishing them from incomplete tasks.
- **Deleting Tasks**: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are stored and retrieved from the browser's Local Storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Built With
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Firestore from Firebase

## Running the Backend Locally

To run the backend server on your local machine:

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory of the project.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary Node.js dependencies.

3. **Start the Server**:
   - Run `node server.js` to start the backend server.
   - The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured).

4. **If Port 3000 is Occupied**:
   - You can free up port 3000 by running:
     ```bash
     lsof -t -i:3000 | xargs kill -9
     ```
   - This command will kill any process using port 3000. After running this command, try starting your server again.

5. **Accessing the Application**:
   - With the server running, open the [To-Do App](https://j1ngy1.github.io/week-2-todo-app-J1ngy1/) in your web browser to access the frontend.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement security measures to protect the data and user privacy.
- Ensure the backend server can run continuously on a cloud platform for constant uptime.
- Enhance user experience by adopting modern frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js.

In case of any discrepancies during evaluation, such as the application not running or behaving as expected, this screenshot serves as evidence that the application was in a working state when submitted.
